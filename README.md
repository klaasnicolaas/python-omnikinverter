Asynchronous Python client for the Omnik Inverter.

## About

A python package with which you can read the data from your Omnik Inverter. Keep in mind that this repository uses webscraping, this is **not** a neat way of data processing but due to the lack of a local API this is the only option.

**NOTE**: In mid-2021, manufacturer Omnik was declared bankrupt. You can find more information about what your alternatives are [here][energiewacht].

## Supported models

- Omnik2000TL2

## Installation

```bash
pip install omnikinverter
```

## Usage

```python
import asyncio

from omnikinverter import OmnikInverter


async def main():
    """Show example on getting Omnik Inverter data."""
    async with OmnikInverter(host="example_host") as client:
        inverter = await client.inverter()
        print(inverter)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
```

# Data

You can read the following data with this package:

- Serial Number
- Inverter Model
- Current Power Production (W)
- Day Energy Production (kWh)
- Total Energy Production (kWh)

## Setting up development environment

This Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency
manager. But also relies on the use of NodeJS for certain checks during
development.

You need at least:

- Python 3.7+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

Create a virtualenv and enter it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

To install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
pre-commit install
```

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
